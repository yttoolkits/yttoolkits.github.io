    <h2>How the YouTube Title Analyzer Works: A Complete Guide</h2>
    <p>
      In the crowded world of YouTube, a compelling title can make or break your video's success. 
      The <strong>YouTube Title Analyzer</strong> helps content creators optimize their titles for better click-through rates (CTR), 
      discoverability, and engagement. Here’s how it works:
    </p>

    <h3>1. Title Length Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      The tool checks your title's character count against YouTube’s best practices (50–60 characters). 
      Titles that are too long might get cut off, while overly short ones may lack key details.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Keyword Density Check</h3>
    <p>
      Keywords are critical for YouTube SEO. The analyzer identifies and evaluates keyword usage, 
      suggesting ways to improve discoverability. It even provides related keyword ideas using external APIs.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Sentiment Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      Sentiment analysis ensures your title has the right emotional tone—engaging and positive without being misleading.
      This helps in building trust and attracting more clicks.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Clickbait Warning</h3>
    <p>
      The tool flags overused clickbait phrases and suggests more honest, engaging alternatives. This protects your reputation 
      while still piquing viewer curiosity.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Improvement Suggestions</h3>
    <p>
      After analyzing the title, the tool provides actionable tips to optimize it. These include shortening long titles, 
      adding relevant keywords, or rephrasing for better emotional appeal.
    </p>

    <h3>Example Use Case</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Original Title:</strong> "10 Amazing Facts About Space"<br>
      <strong>Suggestions:</strong><br>
      - Length: Add more detail for 50–60 characters.<br>
      - Keywords: Include terms like "space exploration" or "astronomy."<br>
      - Sentiment: Add engaging words like "mind-blowing" or "incredible."<br>
      <strong>Improved Title:</strong> "10 Mind-Blowing Facts About Space Exploration"
    </p>

    <h3>Why Use This Tool?</h3>
    <p>
      The YouTube Title Analyzer saves time, improves discoverability, and helps you craft titles that drive engagement. 
      Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned creator, this tool makes optimizing titles simple and effective.
